# Week 7 - Structured Concurrency

This week does not contain any fundamentally new material, but merely
elaborates on previous content.

## Suggested Reading

* [Course Notes Chapter 7](https://diku-dk.github.io/ap-notes/chapter_7.html)

### Going Beyond

## Exercises

None this week. I suggest working on A6 as the handin deadline is
earlier than usual.
